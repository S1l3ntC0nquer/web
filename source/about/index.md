# Whoami

Hello world. My name is **Kalpesh Solanki**, and the IDs I often use in the cyber world are **S1l3ntC0nquer** & **The Star** (since S1l3ntC0nquer is hard to pronounce). I am currently a college student, majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I want to become a really great hacker, just like Condor or The Mentor.

I'm a perfectionist, always striving to optimize everything in my life. When I fall short of my own expectations, it frustrates me, even though I know perfection is unattainable. Sometimes I try too hard and
make a lot of things overflow, such as my brain, my schedule, my emotions, etc.

Knowing that I'm just an ordinary person, I often wonder if my dreams are too big or too ambitious. But even so, I'll still keep trying to reach the goals just because of fun and my curiousity.

# Why S1l3ntC0nquer

> "Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk." — **_IRONMAN_**

S1l3ntC0nquer captures the essence of quiet dominance—a name chosen because true power needs no noise. It’s about mastering the unseen, dismantling obstacles with precision, and embracing solitude as a source of strength. "S1l3ntC0nquer" reflects a hacker’s ultimate mindset: to conquer without a trace, finding brilliance and control in silence.. I hope this ID constantly reminds me to cherish and enjoy every moment of solitude, aspiring to become a young and brilliant star (and that’s why I say you can call me The S1l3ntC0nquer).

# My Dreams

I have a lot of dreams so it's hard to list all of them here. But one of them is that I hope one day I can become a hacker remembered by the world.

I'm not a good hacker yet, and I also don't know how long it will take to become one. But the one thing I know is that I will keep staying on my path. Even if people laugh at me and don't believe in me, I still believe in myself and my talent. Yes, I'm not the smartest. But I'm the one who has dreams. And to achieve them, I will keep learning and keep hacking.

I hope one day, people will remember my name and my ID, remember **Kalpesh Solanki**, remeber The Star, remeber **S1l3ntC0nquer**.
